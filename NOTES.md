Notes
=====

Development was done with Python 2.

Setup
===

1. Python 2.7 must be installed and set up. There are no external dependencies required.
2. The pfxsearch script can be run either as a script or a python file (```./pfxsearch ...``` or ```python pfxsearch ...```)

Usage
===

You can run the script via ```./pfxsearch prefix```. For a complete list of command line options, run ```./pfxsearch -h```.

Alternative dictionaries
===

This supports other dictionaries other than the default given one (in case the dictionary is deleted or moved and the script can't find it). The full path of an alternative dictionary can be passed to the script via the ```--dictionary path``` command line option.
